💡 PROTOCOL SELECTION GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------
🏃 For Real-time Applications: CoAP, MQTT
🔒 For High-Reliability Systems: Apache Kafka, AMQP
📱 For IoT/Edge Computing: CoAP, MQTT
🌐 For Web-based Systems: WebSocket, HTTP/HTTPS
📡 For Large-scale Deployments: Apache Kafka, gRPC
⚖️  For Balanced Performance: gRPC, WebSocket

🔬 TECHNICAL INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------
• Lightweight protocols (CoAP, MQTT) excel in low-latency scenarios
• Message queue protocols (Kafka, AMQP) provide superior reliability
• Binary protocols (gRPC) offer good balance of speed and features
• Text-based protocols (HTTP, XMPP) have higher overhead but better debugging
• Network conditions significantly impact all protocols
